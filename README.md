# Vigenere pass size

A small and simple python script to get some statistics on what could be the size of the cipher password.

This is more of a library sort of thing so you should call the get_pass_statistics function in your code.

I took some inspiration from the black chamber website, you can check it here: http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/vigenere_cracking_tool.html
